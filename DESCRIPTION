Description: Implements contrast analysis integrated with Campbell (2024) 
    TOST equivalence testing. Decomposes 
    between-group variance into a theory-driven contrast of interest and 
    orthogonal residual contrasts, then tests whether the predicted pattern 
    is significant (NHST) and whether deviations from it are negligibly 
    small (TOST). Uses the Intersection-Union Test (IUT; Berger, 1982) 
    principle: no alpha correction is needed across orthogonal contrasts. 
    Supports between-subjects and within-subjects designs, standardized 
    (d) and share-of-variance equivalence bounds, forest plots, and 
    variance decomposition plots.
